<h1>Overview:</h1><br>
The project aimed to solve the challenge On The Way To the Sun, proposed in the NASA Space Apps 2022. We made a quiz game with information about the challenges and discoveries the Parker Solar Probe experienced in it's journey to the sun.

<h1>Challenge Description:</h1><br>
On April 28, 2021, during its eighth flyby of the Sun, Parker Solar Probe did what no other human-made object has ever done: it “touched” the Sun—meaning the spacecraft flew through the Sun’s upper atmosphere (the corona) and sampled particles and magnetic fields there. Your challenge is to develop a creative way to tell young audiences the inspiring story of Parker’s record-breaking journey from Earth to the Sun and all the perils it overcame on the way.

<h1>Objectives:</h1><br>
Your challenge is to develop a creative way to tell young audiences the story of how Parker Solar Probe became the first human-made object to enter the Sun’s atmosphere—including all the dangers Parker Solar Probe encountered and overcame on its way to the Sun and what lessons we could learn from Parker’s journey.

<h1>Proposed solution:</h1><br>
We attempt to make a quiz game so that the players can show their knowledge about the Parker Solar Probe mission. The game is divide in sections, where in each section a diferent part of the journey is presented in form of a story, and after the story the player have to correctly answer the questions of the quiz in order to help the probe in it's journey. For each answer, the probe travels closer to the sun.

<h1>Specials thanks:</h1><br>
The Solar Trekker team wish to thank the organizers of the Nasa Space Apps 2022 for helding the event and disponibilizing the resources used in the solution.
