## Overview:
> The project aimed to solve the challenge On The Way To the Sun, proposed in the NASA Space Apps 2022. We made a quiz game with information about the challenges and > discoveries the Parker Solar Probe experienced in it's journey to the sun.

## Challenge Description:
> On April 28, 2021, during its eighth flyby of the Sun, Parker Solar Probe did what no other human-made object has ever done: it “touched” the Sun—meaning the >spacecraft flew through the Sun’s upper atmosphere (the corona) and sampled particles and magnetic fields there. Your challenge is to develop a creative way to tell > young audiences the inspiring story of Parker’s record-breaking journey from Earth to the Sun and all the perils it overcame on the way.

## Objectives:
> Your challenge is to develop a creative way to tell young audiences the story of how Parker Solar Probe became the first human-made object to enter the Sun’s >atmosphere—including all the dangers Parker Solar Probe encountered and overcame on its way to the Sun and what lessons we could learn from Parker’s journey.

## Proposed solution:
> We attempt to make a quiz game so that the players can show their knowledge about the Parker Solar Probe mission. The game is divide in sections, where in each >section a diferent part of the journey is presented in form of a story, and after the story the player have to correctly answer the questions of the quiz in order to > help the probe in it's journey. For each answer, the probe travels closer to the sun.

## Specials thanks
> The Solar Trekker team wish to thank the organizers of the Nasa Space Apps 2022 for helding the event and disponibilizing the resources used in the solution.
